This program is designed to cycle through the trending deals 
from popular Canadian financial forum RedFlagDeals 
and notify once a new deal satisfying the engagement criteria.

The engagement criteria is whether or not the ratio of 
upvotes / replies is greater than 2, which is my personal
weighting, tuned after some trial and error.

This is intended to be run as a cron job, on a time interval
that fits desired notification tolerance.
